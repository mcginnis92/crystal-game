Crystal Collector Game
by Molly Moran (2018)

This game was created for a week4 project of coding bootcamp. Technologies used to create the game include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

The premise of the game is for the user to collect crystals with hidden values, and upon clicking them, their values are added to a score box. Once a score is equivalent to the random target score determined at the beginning of the game, the user wins.

To start the game, simply click on a crystal.
